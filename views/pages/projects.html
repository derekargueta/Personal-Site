        <p>An augmented-reality game for Apple Watch and iPhone where users can
        drop virtual traps into the actual world for their friends to run into.
        Heavily utilizes geographic programming concepts such as geofencing and
        Apple's Core Location services. Parse powered the backend. Developed in
        24 hours at AngelHack San Francisco</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Was hired as a freelance web developer to create the online platform
        for Dreamling Books. I built the site on Django, and wrote both the 
        front-end and back-end code. Included an automated email reply system,
        user profiles &amp; authentication, custom UI elements such as
        lightboxes, as well as various administrative functionality that was
        achieved by extending Django's admin site. The website was also fully
        responsive for mobile users. Used MySQL for the database.</p>

        <p>Lunchbox is a mobile app that helps college students find free food
        events at their campus. Organizations can pay to host their event on the
        app. Originally founded by David Hepworth and Chase Roberts, I was hired
        to help revamp the app as well as its Django backend.</p>

        </h3>
        <p>Groupsmart is a mobile app to help students easily find and create
        study groups by providing an app specialized to do so, thus providing
        a single source rather than scrounging around for study groups via
        social media and word of mouth. Originally founded by myself and my
        roommate at the time Hunter Kehoe, we built v1.0 of this app for a
        mobile app contest hosted by the Rollins Center for Entrepreneurship
        and Technology, in the BYU Marriott School of Management. We won $400
        for our entry. The backend was in PHP and MySQL but that has since been
        updated to Django + PostgreSQL. I wrote the native iOS app and Hunter 
        wrote the Android counterpart.
